# TitanicEDA
This project explores the Titanic dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Key steps include data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and building a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival.

Key Features:
Data cleaning and handling missing values
Visual insights using seaborn and matplotlib
Feature engineering with categorical variable encoding
Logistic Regression implementation with scikit-learn
Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
